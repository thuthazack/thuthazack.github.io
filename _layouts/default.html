									<!-- <h2>Modern embedded systems like IoT and LPWAN are changing fast, and I want to be in the driver's seat in making the change happen</h2> -->
								Welcome! My name is Thuta Aung, but you can call me Zack. I am a fresh graduate from University of Michigan with a BSE in computer engineering. My primary area of focus is within firmware/low level software development of low powered embedded systems.
								<br><br>

									I like to keep myself busy at all times. Currently, I am working on developing a device called Smart Sensor Interface as a part of Professor Robert Dick's team while working as a part time 
								marketing manager of a startup that I cofounded called BridgeBurma.

												<div style="font-size: 3em;color:white">
														This article describes an Internet-of-Things sensor interface that converts bare sensors and manual sensing systems into automated, wireless sensing systems. It has the goal of supporting a very wide range of sensing applications, implying the need for a very general design. The sensing system has several novel design features dictated by the application requirements including automated calibration to compensate for process variation and temperature dependence of components within the sensing system.

										<div style="font-size: 3em;color:white;">
											The proposed goal of our wearable Spinosaurus was to provide weightlifters feedback on their back form while squatting and deadlifting. It is comprised of a vest (the SpineAligner) that stretches across the spin and an Android phone app. The vest has the ability to measure the orientation of
											the user's back with three inertial measurment units (IMUs) and then communicates with the phone app to display visual feedback.
