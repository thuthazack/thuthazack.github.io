								Welcome! My name is Thuta Aung, but you can call me Zack. I am a fresh graduate from University of Michigan with a BSE in computer engineering. My primary area of focus is within firmware/low level software development of low powered embedded systems.
								<br><br>

									I like to keep myself busy at all times. Currently, I am working on developing a device called Smart Sensor Interface as a part of Professor Robert Dick's team while working as a part time 
								marketing manager of a startup that I cofounded called BridgeBurma.
